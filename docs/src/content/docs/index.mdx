import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Sentinel is a small CLI that automates non-code checks for pull requests. It loads your
plugins, inspects the diff from the active provider, and posts a single comment with a structured report.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Provider aware" icon="cloud-check">
    Sentinel resolves a provider (local, GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) so plugins can
    read pull request metadata and diff information.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Plugin driven" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Plugins implement optional `setup` and `run` hooks to prepare resources and emit
    messages via the shared reporter.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Single report" icon="flag">The runner aggregates messages from every plugin and posts one Markdown summary to the provider.</Card>
</CardGrid>

## How it works

1. The CLI loads `sentinel.config.ts` or `sentinel.config.js` from the current working directory.
2. It resolves the provider (defaulting to `local`) and loads any configured plugins.
3. Each plugin runs against the pull request diff and metadata and uses the shared reporter to add info, warnings, or failures.
4. Sentinel compiles the collected messages into a Markdown summary and posts it back through the provider.

## Resources

- Follow the [Getting started guide](/guides/getting-started/) to build and run Sentinel locally.
- Read the [Configuration reference](/reference/configuration/) for provider options and plugin shapes.
